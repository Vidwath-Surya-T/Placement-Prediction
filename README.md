# Placement-Prediction
<br/>
Project: Placement Prediction using Random Forest Classifier
<br/>
## Overview
<br/>
This project aims to predict whether a student will be placed based on certain attributes like CGPA and IQ using a Random Forest Classifier. The code is written in Python and uses libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, scikit-learn for machine learning, and matplotlib & seaborn for data visualization.
<br/>
## Dataset
Placement.csv: The dataset contains information about students, including their CGPA, IQ, and Placement status.
The Student_ID column is removed, as it is not relevant for the prediction model.
<br/>
## Usage
<br/>
<ul>  
Loading the Dataset: Ensure the Placement.csv file is in the same directory as the code.
Running the Code: Run the script, and it will:
Train the model.
Predict placement status on the test set.
Display the accuracy and confusion matrix.
</ul>
