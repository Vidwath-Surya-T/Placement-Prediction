# Placement-Prediction
<br/>
Project: Placement Prediction using Random Forest Classifier
<br/>
<h3>Overview</h3> 
<br/>
This project aims to predict whether a student will be placed based on certain attributes like CGPA and IQ using a Random Forest Classifier. The code is written in Python and uses libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, scikit-learn for machine learning, and matplotlib & seaborn for data visualization.
<br/>
<h3>Dataset</h3>
Placement.csv: The dataset contains information about students, including their CGPA, IQ, and Placement status.
The Student_ID column is removed, as it is not relevant for the prediction model.
<br/>
<h3>Usage</h3> 
<br/>
<ul>  
<li>Loading the Dataset: Ensure the Placement.csv file is in the same directory as the code.
Running the Code: Run the script, and it will:</li>
<li>Train the model.</li>
<li>Predict placement status on the test set.</li>
<li>Display the accuracy and confusion matrix.</li>
</ul>
